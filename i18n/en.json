This could be through a variety of methods, such as a WebUI, a bot that adds roles to a user (in a service like Discord or Revolt), or in a service that chooses to integrate natively. Finally, there is the Identity server, this will store a list of users (identified by their federated username) and hashed information of their social information to allow for a fallback in case the homeserver doesn't have federation set up correctly.",

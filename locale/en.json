It will be the homeserver's responsibility to store user information and information about pronouns or other basic information. The client will be responsible for displaying the information to the user. This could be through a variety of methods, such as a WebUI, a bot that adds roles to a user (in a service like Discord or Revolt), or in a service that chooses to integrate natively. Finally, there is the Identity server, this will store a list of users (identified by their federated username) and hashed information of their social information to allow for a fallback in case the homeserver doesn't have federation set up correctly.",
